//TODO: Reorganise files and class locations
//TODO: Implement all the blood tests and background variables
//TODO: Rebuild the Fluid system to be based on values and not ratios (unless appropriate)


//URGENT: WTF am I doing with that Drug class??? Is it supposed to be like that?
//URGENT: That PatientFluid.cs is looking thinner than a russian supermodel. Oh look a struct, lets see how long that lasts...


//URGENT: Build Examination+Intervention system. (Started?)


//TODO: Rebuild OrganState enum, perhaps use a float to indicate organ health? another float for OrganFunctionEffectiveness (nice short variable name there) (Started?)

//LATER: Implement Pain and infection mechanics

//REVIEW: All interventions require review following the addition of PatientDefaults.cs: DefaultPlayerStatsTEMP (Not really a default, more placeholder) and  DefaultWasteProduction

//URGENT: This feels like it has turned into my usual clusterfuck. STOP ADDING NEW SHIT AND FIX THE EXISTING PILE OF SHIT
